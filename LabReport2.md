# Lab Report 2

This lab report will consist of three Parts:

1. Part 1 - StringServer
2. Part 2 - One bug from Lab 3
3. Part 3 - Learning from Labs in Week 2 or Week 3

## Part 1

*

## Part 2

* One bug from Lab 3 that I will be addressing in this report is the error in the method **reversed**.
* A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, was writing a test case such as:
```
@Test
public void testReversed1() {
  int[] input1 = {1,2,3};
  assertArrayEquals(new int[]{3,2,1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
}
```

## Part 3
