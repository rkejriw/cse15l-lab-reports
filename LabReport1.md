# Lab Report 1

To set-up for CSE 15L, you will have to go through the following three steps:

1. Downloading VScode
2. Remotely Connecting the terminal 
3. Trying some commands on VScode

## Downoading VScode

* To download VScode onto you respective devices, you can use the following website (link: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) for instructions! 
* The device I am using is a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip. For different operating systems, there will be different steps to follow so choose the ones that work for your device.
* Since I took CSE 8B the previous quarter, I already have VScode installed onto my device and therefore I skipped the first step of installation and continued from the second step. For those of you that have done the same (taken CSE 8B/ CSE 11) probably have VScode installed as well.
* Here's an example of how VScode should look like once you open it on your laptop! ![Image](vscode.png)
* Now your all set to move onto Step 2!

## Remotely Connecting

* To connect remotely, first you will have to open a new terminal in VScode. ![Image](newterminal.png)
* After opening the terminal, type in the follwing to connect the terminal with your CSE 15L course specific account. Replace the zz here with the letters in YOUR course-specifc account.
` $ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` Now run the command.
* If this is the first time you have connected to the server, you will get a prompt like this:
```
ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
