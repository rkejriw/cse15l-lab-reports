# Lab Report 1

To set-up for CSE 15L, you will have to go through the following three steps:

1. Downloading VScode
2. Remotely Connecting the terminal 
3. Trying some commands on VScode

## Downoading VScode

* To download VScode onto you respective devices, you can use the following website for instructions! website link: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* The device I am using is a Macbook Pro with an M1 chip. For different devices, there will be different steps to follow so choose the ones that work for your device.
* Since I took CSE 8B the previous quarter, I already have VScode installed onto my device. For those of you that have done the same (taken CSE 8B/ CSE 11) probably have VScode installed as well.
* Here's an example of how VScode should look like once you open it on your laptop! ![Image]
